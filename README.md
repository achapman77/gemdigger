## GemDigger: Bloc's code review team site.

Each week we will be digging deep into a popular open-source library.
The main goal is to unpack and review well-polished, clean code.
Ancillary goals may include reviewing code and attempting to make improvements to not so polished code.

## Rules of Conduct

1. Teams are self-organizing, but each person on a team holds the others accountable.
2. Shipping matters. Projects should be deployed early and often.
3. Positivity matters. We're all here to learn and improve our skills, but we're also here to have fun. Negativity or condescension won't be tolerated.
4. Ask for feedback. You have the entire Bloc community at your disposal, use it. This includes Bloc HQ. Use the Facebook group to ask for feedback, help and advice.
5. Attendance, habits and routine. Hacker clubs teams won't work if people miss meetings. Once a team decides on a weekly meeting time, team members should do everything they can to make it. If good habits are established, teams will be successful.
